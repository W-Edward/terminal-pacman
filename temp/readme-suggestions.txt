ok im just gonna put some ideas here instead of directly editing readme, consider:

- Use bold instead of heading 3 (###) for formatting headings under Heading 2s (##)
- The following criteria should suppport the features we implemented, not the other way 'round
    Generation of random game sets or events
    Data structures for storing game status
    Dynamic memory management
    File input/output
    Program codes in multiple files
